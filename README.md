# mesosphere-freefall
In our exploration, we surf into the complexities of the earth's gravitation, building a symphony of variables to analyze the fall of an object from 50000 meters in height to earthly bounds. From the dynamic forces of gravity to the little fluctuation of air resistance, our analysis developed through mathematical modeling and numerical solutions. At the heart of our inquiry is Euler's method, a mathematical model helping us to reach the final destination of our analysis. We ran simulations to unfold the physics of falling bodies, considering parameters such as mass, initial and final altitudes, terminal velocity, and air drag force. Through this paper, we examined the changing of gravity, air pressure, and air density with altitude. then we examined the dependence on the velocity of the falling body considering the changes in these parameters.
